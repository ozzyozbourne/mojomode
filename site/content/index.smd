This sample website showcases:

- A couple simple pages
  - `content/index.smd`
  - `content/about.smd`
- A blog
  - `content/blog/index.smd`
  - `content/blog/first-post/index.smd`
  - `content/blog/second-post.smd`

## Next steps

Make sure to read the [official Zine docs](https://zine-ssg.io/docs/)
and then start editing this website!

Start by putting the correct information in `zine.ziggy` and then start editing
the existing pages. Before deleting existing copy consider giving it a brief
look as it will show you some SuperMD specific syntax.

HTML markup in Zine is defined via SuperHTML templates:
- `layouts/index.shtml`
- `layouts/page.shtml`
- `layouts/post.shtml`
- `layouts/blog.shtml`
- `layouts/blog.xml`
- `layouts/devlog.shtml`
- `layouts/devlog.xml`
- `layouts/devlog-archive.shtml`
- `layouts/templates/base.shtml`

**If you're running the Zine development server (by running `zine`), then all
changes you make will be picked up immediately, causing the website to rebuild
and the page in your browser to refresh**.

You can learn more about SuperMD and SuperHTML in [/about/](/about/).

Lastly, this sample website also includes the following asset files:

- `assets/style.css`
- `assets/hightlight.css`
- `assets/under-construction.gif`
- `assets/katex-tag.js`
- `assets/katex0.16.21.css`
- `assets/katex0.16.21.js`
- `content/blog/first-post/fanzine.jpg`

The first few asset files are **site assets**, while the last is a **page asset** that belongs to the "first post" page.

The Zine docs contain more information about [dealing with assets](https://zine-ssg.io/docs/assets/).
